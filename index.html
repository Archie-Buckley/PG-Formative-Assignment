                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, the Earth has been heating up at an exponentially higher ratel.<br>Action on this issue is needed now, although political squabbling has led many to close their eyes to the threat that is posed by climate change, and as a result we are drawing close to crossing a line we cannot take back.</p>
                    
                    <p>This video by hbomberguy [1] expresses the problems with global warming in a somewhat humourous way.</p>

            <h2>Causes</h2>
     
                <h3>Natural</h3>
                    <p>There are some natural causes of climate change, although these are by no means enough to have such an impact on the world.<br>These include variations in the Earth's orbit and tilt as the orbit moves from circular to eliptical and so draws closer to the sun. The changes in the tilt of the planet also increase heat impacting on certain areas and heating it up.[2] <br>Many use arguments such as these, as well as the fact that we have had ice ages previously to excuse man-made climate change and state that the rapid temperature changes are natural, that prominent figures who express this view have usually taken large donations from wealthy oil barons and tend to be high ranking politicians makes tackling the issue difficult.</p>
                <h3>Man-Made</h3>
                    <p>The increasing rate of temperature rise since the 1700s is not a coincidence. Most global warming occurs through the Greenhouse Effect, where greenhouse gases - most notably Carbon Dioxide and Methane - rise into the atmosphere and create a metaphorical blanket that reflects heat trying to leave the atmosphere, heating the planet up.<br>Much of the release of these greenhouse gases comes from energy generation - specifically the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil - industrial scale farming - methane - and global transport such as planes and global shipping routes. </p>

                <h2>Effects</h2>
                    <p>The effects of rising temperatures are many and varied. The most well-mentioned and obvious of these is the melting ice caps and receding glaciers. These not only endanger species, but also mean rising sea levels<br>These rising sea levels would be disasterous, as low lying areas such at the Netherlands and Bangladesh would be devastated, along with many coastal cities all over the world from the US to China. [3] This would lead to a massive immigration crisis as all these displaced people move elsewhere.<br>Other impacts of climate change include increased desertification, making it harder for people to live in much of Africa and Central Asia, a large loss of biodiversity across the globe, leading to a medicine shortage, and an increase in extreme weather conditions, from heatwaves to tropical storms.</p>

            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>While it may seem impossible that we can do much about this, the Earth finally seems to have opened its eyes in recent years. Global leaders are meeting for a summit in Scotland in early November to discuss how to tackle climate change [4]; this is the level of action that is needed.<br>Many believe there are things individuals can do to help save the planet too, but while recycling plastics or becoming vegan may make you feel better about it, unfortunately without a massive societal shift, this will amount to nothing overall.<br>I'm not saying that you should NOT do those things, you absolubtely should if you can, but more decisive action worldwide is needed. This could take the form of governments stopping subsidies to coal and gas companies and focusing wholly on renewable energy, persuing policies of reforestation to help combat the increased levels of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere, or even using new carbon capture technology to help offset any emissions.</p>

            <h3>A List of Possible Solutions for Governments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class = "cat2">Stop Subsidising Fossil Fuels and Instead Focus on Renewables</li>
                <li class = "cat2">Stop Fearmongering Over Nuclear Power - It is much better and despite Chenobyll, the risks are much lower</li>
                <li class = "cat2">Focus on Electric Cars and Sustainable Methods of Transport</li>
                <li class = "cat2">Use Home Grown/Made Goods When Possible - It reduces costs of global shipping and also invokes patriotism in voters for the government</li>
                <li class = "cat2">Develop Carbon Capture Technology and Persue Reforestation</li>
                <li class = "cat2">Cut Down on Unnecessary International Travel - Does the Prime Minister really need that many flights?</li>
                <li class = "cat2">Co-operate With Other Governments - The issue cannot be solved by one country working alone, a concerted globewide effort is needed</li>
